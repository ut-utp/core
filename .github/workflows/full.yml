# TODO: feature combinations (for now it's fine since we don't have any real
# ones).

# Bench, if that ever becomes necessary.
# TODO: it is now necessary!
# So, we'll have a bench thing for PRs that's just `criterion-compare-action`
# But then we'll also have a thing that, for each push:
#   - runs the benchmarks/generates the reports
#   - uses critcomp to make the json file
#   - uploads both to the gh-pages branch under benches/<branch name>/<commit hash>
#      + also adds the corresponding entry on the index page
