//! Functions that help applications run event loops around [`Control`] impls.
//!
//! ## No RPC Configurations
//!
//! In a no-rpc configuration, the application needs to call `Control::tick()`
//! often enough to actually make progress on any pending event futures.
//!
//! Assuming that the application doesn't have a separate execution thread, the
//! application needs to balance the following things on its main thread:
//!   - incoming events (i.e. user input, periodic update)
//!   - calling tick
//!
//! A naÃ¯ve way to do this is to just call check for new events and call tick in
//! a loop. Like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! loop {
//!     let e = loop {
//!         if let Ok(e) = recv.try_recv() { break e; }
//!         else {
//!             sim.tick()
//!         }
//!     };
//!
//!     handle_event(e);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The problem with this is that another goal of ours is to sleep when we have
//! nothing to do. With the solution above, we'd consume an entire core: even
//! when there are no new events and nothing actually happens in tick.
//!
//! The way we solved this for RPC setups was to have some kind of backoff
//! solution. `Control::tick` indicates to us whether it actually did any work
//! so if we discovered that no work was being done for a time, we'd sleep a
//! little (progressively longer for the longer it's been since we had real work
//! to do) before trying to do work again. This worked well enough for our RPC
//! setups.
//!
//! The problem with doing something like the above for _non-rpc_ setups is that
//! we do other things in the thread besides just calling `Control::tick`. If we
//! sleep, then other events won't be handled promptly. Put another way, the
//! amount we sleep by in the above approach reflects how much work the Control
//! impl is doing, but does *not* take into account whether we're receiving
//! events (we don't need a back off system for events since we can wait for
//! them instead of just polling for them). Ideally, we'd like to prioritize
//! events above sleeping while also not calling tick all the time.
//!
//! Conveniently there's a function on `mpsc::Receiver` that let's us block on
//! the next message _for some amount of time_ which let's us do exactly what we
//! want.
//!
//! Because we need to block on the next message in order to prioritize event
//! handling over sleeping/running tick, we need to do a little bit of an
//! inversion in how the control flow works. Rather than have the main loop call
//! us, a backoff/tick execution function, we will become the main loop and ask
//! for a function that we will call whenever events are sent and need to be
//! handled.
//!
//! ## RPC Configurations
//!
//! In an RPC configuration, things are actually simpler.
//!
//! #### Device Side
//!
//! The device thread of execution, free from having to do things other than
//! call step, can just call step and sleep.
//!
//! #### Controller Side
//!
//! The controller side still has a tick function to call, but it should never
//! _need_ to be called. The return value that the [`Controller`]'s
//! [`Control::tick`] indicates this. So, if we run such a [`Control`] impl
//! [exactly as we run a non-rpc `Control` impl](#no-rpc-configuration), the
//! event loop should quickly converge on basically just sleeping for the max
//! amount of time (allowing for events to interrupt this sleep) before calling
//! tick a few times. This is close to ideal (ideal being a pure blocking recv
//! call that puts the thread to sleep until messages come in).
//!
