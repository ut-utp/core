peripheral_trait! {gpio,
/// GPIO access trait.
///
/// Implementations of this trait must provide digital read, digital write, and rising
/// edge trigger interrupt functionality for 8 GPIO pins which we'll call G0 - G7.
///
/// Additionally, implementors of this trait must also provide an implementation of
/// [`Default`](core::default::Default).
///
/// ### State
/// The interpreter (user of this trait) will set the states of all the pins to
/// [`GpioState::Disabled`] on startup, so implementations can choose any default state
/// they wish.
///
/// Implementations should maintain the state of the GPIO pins and querying this state
/// ([`get_state`]) should be an infallible operation.
///
/// Setting pin state ([`set_state`]) is not infallible as implementations may change
/// need to actually change the state of hardware peripherals in order to, for example,
/// register a rising-edge interrupt for a particular pin. Though implementors are
/// encouraged to make this operation infallible if possible, we realize this isn't
/// always possible and in the event that it isn't, we'd rather have implementors pass
/// the error onto the interpreter instead of panicking.
///
/// ### Reads and Writes
/// Reading from pins should fail (with a [`GpioReadError`]) when pins are disabled or
/// in output ([`GpioState::Output`]) mode. *Note:* reading from pins in interrupt
/// ([`GpioState::Interrupt`]) mode is allowed.
///
/// Writing from pins should fail (with a [`GpioWriteError`]) when pins are disabled or
/// in input ([`GpioState::Input`]) or interrupt ([`GpioState::Interrupt`]) mode.
///
/// ### Interrupts
/// Registering interrupts (i.e. calling [`register_interrupt`]) does not automatically
/// put a pin in [`interrupt`](GpioState::Interrupt) mode. Instead, this only updates
/// the handler function for a pin.
///
/// Handler functions are `FnMut` implementors (they're allowed to mutate state) that
/// take a [`GpioPin`] corresponding to the pin for which the rising-edge interrupt just
/// fired.
///
/// Implementations should store the last handler function provided to
/// [`register_interrupt`] _across pin state changes_. As in, if G0 (GPIO pin 0)'s
/// handler is set to function A (i.e. `register_interrupt(GpioPin::G0, A)`), and then
/// G0's state is changed to [`output`](GpioState::Output) and then to
/// [`disabled`](GpioState::Disabled) and then to [`interrupt`](GpioState::Interrupt), A
/// should be called when G0 goes from low to high.
///
/// Implementors should use a no-op handler (do nothing) for the pins by default. All
/// users of this trait _should_ register handlers on initialization (just as they will
/// explicitly set the state of all pins to [disabled](GpioState::Disabled)), but
/// implementors shouldn't bank on this.
///
/// As is probably obvious, implementors should only call the handler function on a
/// rising edge *if the pin is in [interrupt](GpioState::Interrupt) mode* (not just if
/// a handler function has been provided).
///
/// ### Default Function Implementations
/// The trait provides naÃ¯ve default implementations of [`get_states`], [`read_all`],
/// and [`write_all`] that just call their single pin variants across all pins; as an
/// implementor you can choose to override these if you wish. If there's an easier way
/// to do a particular operation across all the pins than just calling the single pin
/// variant in a loop, then it's probably worth doing; i.e. if you happen to store
/// [`GpioState`]s for the pins in an array, you could override [`get_states`] to just
/// return your array pretty easily. Otherwise, the default implementations should work
/// fine.
///
/// ### Tests
/// There are [tests for this trait](crate::tests::gpio) in the [tests
/// module](crate::tests) to help ensure that your implementation of this trait follows
/// the rules above.

    // But really, enabling interrupts and having them go to the default handler should be possible... (default handler should probably do nothing!)
